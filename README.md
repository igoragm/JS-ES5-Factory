# JS-ES5-Factory

Simplified version of the TableFactory functionality that I have implemented at one point in my career. 

I was relying on Tabulator JavaScript library (http://tabulator.info) but for this ocassion the Tabulator itself is not included as the purpose of this example is demonstrate the power of prototype based system JavaScript offers.

So take a look if you need a way (or just some inspiration) to have a single-instance utility in ES5 environment that is capable to provide base/default functionality and at the same time be flexible enough to be overrideable on module to module basis.
